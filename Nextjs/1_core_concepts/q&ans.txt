----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What is Next.js and why would you use it over React?  
->Next js is react based framework that adds production-ready features like routing, rendering Strategies, seo support and performence optimization. 

I would go with nextjs over plain react js because it removes a lot of setup and archhitectural decisiions. It gives me fast development, fewer custom solution.



2. What problems does Next.js solve?  
-> such as 
    * Poor SEO with client side rendering
    * Slow initial page load
    * Manual routing and code splitting
    * complex data fetching pattern
    * Performence optimization overhead


3. How does Next.js differ from Create React App(CRA)?  
->CRA is client based setup focusing on development simplicity however nextjs is a full stack based on react

We can do server redering, data fetching, static generation, apis routes in nextjs, CRA requires to all a lot of configuration for that. 



4. What are the main features of Next.js? 
->
 - File based routing
 - Api routes, server actions
 - server side rendering and static generation
 - server and client componenets
 - img and font optimization
 - better seo performence



5. Explain the file-based routing system in Next.js  
-> Nextjs use file based routing to "Define routes". Each folder represents a route segment and that files like page.tsx, layout.tsx defin the behavior

Its a good approach to predict the route as anyone from the can understand navigation just by looking at the folder structure. 

localhost/3000/contact -> contact is a folder and the contents of the folder is page.tsx.



6. What is the pages router vs the app router?  
->page route    - older routing system based on page directories
                - relies on data fecthing methods like getServerSiderProps()


->App route     - Newest system based on react server componets.
                - it supports layout, streaming, nested routes and better data fetching



7. What is the role of layout.tsx in the App Router?  
-> Its a shared ui that persists across routes like header, sidebar, footer

it avoid re-rendeingn common components. 



8. What is use client and why is it needed?  
->When you want any pages to behave like a client component you use "use client". It marks that this page is a client component. 

By defualt evey page on nextjs is a server componet. You must explicitly mention "user client" in order to make it client component. 

Its needed when you use browser features like dom manipulation, useEffect, even handlers. 



9. What are Server Components in Next.js?  
->  - Run only on the server, 
    - fetches data directly, access secure resources and send rendered ui

    

10. What are Client Components in Next.js?
->  - Run only on the client,
    - handles interactivity like clicking, forms and animations.
